# CODTECH.TASK3
# Predictive Modeling with Classification

**COMPANY**: CODTECT IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME**:MUHSINA CT

**INTERN ID**:CT08FAA

**DOMAIN**:DATA SCIENCE

**BATCH DURATION**:20 DECEMBER 2024 TO 20 JANUARY 2025


## Overview

This project applies various classification algorithms to build predictive models. It involves data preprocessing, training models, and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Algorithms Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

## Steps

1. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train and evaluate models using the testing set.
4. Compare models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion

The model with the best performance will be selected as the most suitable for the task.
